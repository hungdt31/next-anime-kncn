**Something about folder app**:

- `action`: Using a system like Redux or another state management library, generally via 'use server'. It defines logic handle for the application.

- `data`: This folder might store static data or mock data used by your application, for example, mock data or JSON files for development purposes.

- `hooks`: This folder contains custom hooks in React, which help reuse logic related to state or side effects (such as useState, useEffect).

- `lib`: This folder usually holds shared functions or utilities used throughout the project. It might include helper functions, API calls, or other commonly used logic.

- `prisma`: With Prisma ORM, this folder typically contains schema definitions for your data models (database schema) and configuration files for Prisma.

- `public`: holds static files such as images, fonts, or other resources that you want to be accessed directly from the browser.

- `types`: This folder usually holds TypeScript definitions, where you define interfaces, types to manage data structures throughout the project.

- `utils`: Similar to lib, this folder contains utility functions, meaning handy functions used across multiple parts of the application (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation).

- `.env`: A file that stores environment variables, typically containing sensitive information like API keys, database settings, or other configuration variables for the project.
